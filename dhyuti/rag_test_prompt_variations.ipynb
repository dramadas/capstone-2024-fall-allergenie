However, I can suggest a recipe that's dairy-free and might interest you.\\n\\nHere's a recipe for a delicious and dairy-free dish:\\n\\n**Title:** Braised Beef Short Ribs with Red Wine and Mushrooms\\n\\n**Ingredients:**\\n\\n* 2 pounds beef short ribs\\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil\\n* 1 onion, sliced\\n* 3 cloves garlic, minced\\n* 2 cups mixed mushrooms (such as cremini, shiitake, and button)\\n* 1 cup red wine\\n* 2 cups beef broth\\n* 1 tablespoon tomato paste\\n* 1 teaspoon dried thyme\\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\\n* Fresh parsley, chopped (optional)\\n\\n**Instructions:**\\n\\n1. Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C).\\n2. Season the short ribs with salt and pepper.\\n3. Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Sear the short ribs until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes per side. Remove the ribs from the pot and set them aside.\\n4. Add the sliced onion to the pot and cook until caramelized, stirring occasionally. This should take about 20-25 minutes.\\n5. Add the minced garlic and cook for 1 minute, until fragrant.\\n6. Add the mixed mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and start to brown, about 5 minutes.\\n7. Add the red wine, beef broth, tomato paste, and thyme to the pot. Stir to combine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot.\\n8. Return the short ribs to the pot, cover, and transfer to the preheated oven. Braise for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, or until the meat is tender and falls off the bone.\\n9. Remove the pot from the oven and let it cool slightly. Serve the short ribs with the rich, flavorful sauce spooned over the top. Garnish with chopped parsley, if desired.\\n\\nThis recipe is dairy-free and should be safe for those with dairy allergies. However, please double-check the ingredients and cooking methods to ensure your safety.\"}\n",
