Turn out onto a board and chop until a paste is formed. Have ingredients measured and nearby before beginning.\\n* Heat the oil in a small skillet over high heat. Add the mustard seeds. (They will begin popping immediately, so have a cover close at hand for escaping seeds.) Cook until popping stops. Lower the heat, add the cumin seeds, and cook until they turn golden, about 1 minute.\\n* Stir in the garlic for 10 seconds, then the ginger for 10 seconds more, and remove from the heat.\\n* Stir in the turmeric, paprika, pepper flakes, and salt.\\n* Mix the spices and yogurt together in a bowl. Chill before serving.\\n\\nPlease note that this recipe is not a traditional French rice dish, but rather a Korean-inspired recipe.

Kosher salt\\n19. 3/4 cups of water\\n20. 4 cups of canola oil, for frying\\n\\n**Instructions:**\\n\\n1. Heat the oil in a sauté pan over medium-high heat until hot.\\n2. Add coriander, red pepper, mustard, turmeric, ginger, garlic, green chilies, kari leaves, and scallions, in this order.\\n3. Saute, stirring for 3 minutes or until the scallions are wilted.\\n4. Add the shrimp and stir-fry until they lose their pink color.\\n5. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, curry powder, and salt.\\n6. Slowly add the water until the dough is well formed and soft but not sticky (you may not use all the water).\\n7. Knead for 2 minutes on a lightly floured surface and then place in a large bowl to rest for at least 15 minutes.\\n8. Cover the bowl with a moist cloth or flip the bowl over on a clean prep surface and let it rest for 15 minutes.\\n9. Divide the dough into 4 equal portions and roll each portion into a thin sheet.\\n10. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.\\n11. Add the shrimp and cook until they are pink and cooked through, about 2-3 minutes per side.\\n12. Remove the shrimp from the oil and place on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.\\n13. In the same skillet, add the coconut milk, water, salt, and black pepper.\\n14. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for 2-3 minutes or until the sauce has thickened slightly.\\n15. Add the cooked shrimp to the coconut sauce and stir to coat.\\n16. Serve warm or at room temperature.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n\\n* You can adjust the amount of chili peppers to your desired level of spiciness.\\n* Traditionally, Meen Molee is served with steamed rice or roti.\\n* You can also add some chopped vegetables like bell peppers, carrots, or potatoes to the sauce for added flavor and texture.'}\n",

      "{'generated_text': '**Braised Beef Tenderloin with Spinach Cakes and Tomato Sauce**\\n\\n**Recipe Name:** Braised Beef Tenderloin with Spinach Cakes and Tomato Sauce\\n\\n**Ingredients:**\\n\\n1. 4 beef tenderloin steaks, 1 1/2 inches thick\\n2. Coarse salt and cracked black pepper, to taste\\n3. 2 tablespoons butter, divided\\n4. 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour\\n5. 1/2 cup dry red wine\\n6. 1/2 cup beef stock, available on soup aisle\\n7. 4 thin slices bacon, look for packaged bacon marked \"Center Cut\" in packaged meats case\\n8. 2 packages frozen chopped spinach, 10 ounces each\\n9. 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\\n10. 1 small onion, chopped\\n11. 1/2 cup Italian bread crumbs\\n12. 1/3 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano\\n13. 2 handfuls, 1 egg, beaten\\n14. 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg\\n15. Eyeball it, Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper\\n16. 1 loaf country style bread, Kosher salt, Ground black pepper, Splash of Cognac (optional)\\n17. 1 cup Fontina or Gruyere cheese, grated finely, slice into half-moon shapes\\n\\n**Instructions:**\\n\\n1. Set electric skillet to 300 degrees and add butter. Once butter has melted, add a layer of onions and sprinkle with a little salt. Repeat layering onions and salt until all onions are in the skillet. Do not try stirring until onions have sweated down for 15 to 20 minutes. After that, stir occasionally until onions are dark mahogany and reduced to approximately 2 cups. This should take 45 minutes to 1 hour. Do not worry about burning.\\n2. Add enough wine to cover the onions and turn heat to high, reducing the wine to a syrup consistency.\\n3. Add consommé, chicken broth, and apple mixture and toss to mix well.\\n4. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, bring milk to a bare simmer over medium heat.\\n5. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg briefly to break it up. Temper the egg by drizzling 1/2 cup of the warm milk in while whisking until incorporated. (This will prevent the egg from scrambling.)\\n6. Mix the tempered egg and the remaining warm milk into the macaroni and stir well until everything is evenly coated.\\n7. Pour the contents of the bowl into the prepared baking pan, spreading the macaroni and sauce evenly.\\n8. In a medium bowl, toss together the pancetta, Parmesan, panko, and parsley, and sprinkle over the top of the macaroni. (This will create a yummy crust.)\\n9. Bake until golden brown and bubbling on top, and the pancetta is crispy, 25 to 30 minutes.\\n10. Serve warm.\\n\\n**Additional Notes or Tips:**\\n\\n* This recipe is a hearty and flavorful Italian main course that combines the tenderloin steaks with spinach cakes and a rich tomato sauce.\\n* The spinach cakes add a nice crunch and flavor contrast to the dish.\\n* You can adjust the amount of wine and broth to your taste.\\n* If you prefer a stronger flavor, you can add more pancetta or use'}\n",

Water for 1 minute until wilted, then shock in ice water\\n\\n**Instructions:**\\n\\n1. Roughly chop the cabbage and transfer to a food processor.\\n2. Pulse until well chopped. Squeeze out excess water and transfer to a large bowl.\\n3. Blanch the soy bean sprouts in the same boiling, salted water for 1 minute and shock in ice water.\\n4. Transfer to a food processor and pulse until well chopped. Squeeze out excess water and add to the cabbage.\\n5. Stir in the chopped tofu. Transfer the mixture to a cheesecloth-lined sieve, place a weighted plate on top of the mixture, and let stand over a bowl in the refrigerator for 2 hours to remove excess water.\\n6. Transfer the vegetable mixture to a bowl. Mix the ingredients in a bowl. Turn out onto a board and chop until a paste is formed. Have ingredients measured and nearby before beginning.\\n7. Heat the oil in a small skillet over high heat. Add the mustard seeds. (They will begin popping immediately, so have a cover close at hand for escaping seeds.) Cook until popping stops. Lower the heat, add the cumin seeds, and cook until they turn golden, about 1 minute.\\n8. Stir in the garlic for 10 seconds, then the ginger for 10 seconds more, and remove from the heat.\\n9. Stir in the turmeric, paprika, pepper flakes, and salt. Mix the spices and yogurt together in a bowl. Chill before serving.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n\\n* You can make the wonton soup base ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or freeze it for up to 2 months.\\n* You can also add other ingredients to the soup base, such as cooked noodles or vegetables, to make it more substantial.\\n* This recipe makes about 4 servings. You can easily double or triple the recipe if needed.\\n\\nI hope you enjoy this recipe! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like any variations or substitutions.\"}\n",

Bouquet garni (thyme sprigs, bay leaf, and parsley tied together with kitchen string)\\n8. 1 cup Fontina or Gruyère cheese, grated and sliced into half-moon shapes\\n9. 2 tablespoons butter\\n\\n**Instructions:**\\n\\n1. Set an electric skillet to 300°F and add butter. Once melted, add a layer of onions and sprinkle with a little salt.\\n2. Repeat layering onions and salt until all onions are in the skillet. Do not stir until onions have sweated down for 15 to 20 minutes.\\n3. After that, stir occasionally until onions are dark mahogany and reduced to approximately 2 cups. This should take 45 minutes to 1 hour. Do not worry about burning.\\n4. Add enough wine to cover the onions and turn heat to high, reducing the wine to a syrup consistency.\\n5. Add consommé, chicken broth, and apple cider. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to simmer.\\n6. Add the bouquet garni and simmer for 2-3 hours or until the meat is tender.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n\\n* You can also cook the short ribs in a Dutch oven or oven-safe pot on the stovetop or in the oven.\\n* If using a Dutch oven, cook at 300°F for 2-3 hours. If using the oven, preheat to 300°F and cook for 2-3 hours.\\n* Remove the bouquet garni before serving.\\n* Serve the short ribs with the braising liquid spooned over the top and crusty bread on the side.'}\n",
