      "* 2-3 apples, peeled and diced (any variety, but firmer apples like Granny Smith work best)\n",
      "* 1/4 cup granulated sugar\n",
      "* 2 tablespoons honey\n",
      "* 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n",
      "* 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg\n",

      "2. In a large bowl, combine the polenta, cornstarch, Parmesan cheese, parsley, salt, pepper, and baking powder.\n",
      "3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg and milk. Add this mixture to the polenta mixture and stir until a dough forms.\n",
      "4. Using your hands, shape the dough into small balls, about 1 1/2 inches (3.8 cm) in diameter. Flatten each ball slightly into a disk shape.\n",
