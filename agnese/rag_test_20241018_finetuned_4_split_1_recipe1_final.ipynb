Combine brown sugar and 5 spice powder. Rub sugar and spice over pork. Brush baking dish or broiler pan with oil. Place pork in oven and bake 10 minutes. Combine barbecue sauce with orange zest and juice and sesame oil. Baste meat liberally with sauce and roast meat 15 minutes longer. Remove meat from oven and transfer to a serving platter. Coat meat with sesame and cilantro or chives for color.\\nCombine mangoes, bell pepper, jalapeno, onion, lime and basil in a bowl. Season with salt, to your taste.\\nPre-heat a large casserole or stock pot. On a plate, mix the cumin, coriander, chile, pepper and sugar. Salt the pieces of pork and season well with the spice mix. Coat the pot with oil and brown the pork on both sides, about 12 minutes. Wipe out pot and coat again with oil. Brown the onions and garlic, about 8 minutes. Deglaze with wine and add the soy, chipotle, bay and cover with water. Check for seasoning. Bring to a boil and let simmer 4 hours until the meat is very soft. Carefully pull out pork and bay leaves. Blend the cooking liquid with a hand blender and check for seasoning. When pork is cool enough to touch, shred the pork by hand. In a large bowl, take 6 cups of shredded pork and mix with the rice, red bells, scallion whites and cilantro. Add the sauce, a small ladle at a time just to moisten the mix. Season and check. Lay the leaves shiny side down, and place 1 cup of filling on each. Wrap by bringing the bottom up first, fold in the sides underneath, then continue\\nHeat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a medium saute pan over high heat. Sear the tenderloin until evenly colored and transfer to the oven. Cook until the pork reaches the internal temperature of 145 degrees F. Remove from the pan and allow to rest 15 minutes. Thinly slice.\\nWhile tenderloin is in the marinade, in a small pot over high heat add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and saute the onions, fennel, garlic and thyme until just colored. Reduce the heat to low and deglaze with the sake. Cover with a lid and cook for 30 minutes, stirring periodically until the onions are translucent and soft. Remove from heat.\\nIn a small bowl, using a fork, mix in the remaining herbs and the goat cheese and season with and salt and pepper, to taste.\\nWhile the onions are cooking, thinly slice the bread. Rub each piece with a garlic clove and season lightly with salt and pepper. Drizzle each piece with olive oil and bake until golden but still soft in the center, 10 minutes.\\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F.\\nIn order to achieve uniform cooking, fold over slender tail end of tenderloin and tie with kitchen twine. Set a large electric griddle at its highest setting; brush the tenderloin with the olive oil and sear on all sides until well browned, approximately 10 minutes. Rest the meat for at least 5 minutes or until it is cool to the touch so as not to melt the dough.\\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\nHow to cook a dish with pork tenderloin?\\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\nProvide a complete recipe following the structure outlined above.\\n\", \"parameters\": {\"max_new_tokens\": 700, \"top_p\": 0.9, \"temperature\": 0.4, \"stop\": [\"<|eot_id|>\"]}}\n",

Combine brown sugar and 5 spice powder. Rub sugar and spice over pork. Brush baking dish or broiler pan with oil. Place pork in oven and bake 10 minutes. Combine barbecue sauce with orange zest and juice and sesame oil. Baste meat liberally with sauce and roast meat 15 minutes longer. Remove meat from oven and transfer to a serving platter. Coat meat with sesame and cilantro or chives for color.\\nCombine mangoes, bell pepper, jalapeno, onion, lime and basil in a bowl. Season with salt, to your taste.\\nPre-heat a large casserole or stock pot. On a plate, mix the cumin, coriander, chile, pepper and sugar. Salt the pieces of pork and season well with the spice mix. Coat the pot with oil and brown the pork on both sides, about 12 minutes. Wipe out pot and coat again with oil. Brown the onions and garlic, about 8 minutes. Deglaze with wine and add the soy, chipotle, bay and cover with water. Check for seasoning. Bring to a boil and let simmer 4 hours until the meat is very soft. Carefully pull out pork and bay leaves. Blend the cooking liquid with a hand blender and check for seasoning. When pork is cool enough to touch, shred the pork by hand. In a large bowl, take 6 cups of shredded pork and mix with the rice, red bells, scallion whites and cilantro. Add the sauce, a small ladle at a time just to moisten the mix. Season and check. Lay the leaves shiny side down, and place 1 cup of filling on each. Wrap by bringing the bottom up first, fold in the sides underneath, then continue\\nHeat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a medium saute pan over high heat. Sear the tenderloin until evenly colored and transfer to the oven. Cook until the pork reaches the internal temperature of 145 degrees F. Remove from the pan and allow to rest 15 minutes. Thinly slice.\\nWhile tenderloin is in the marinade, in a small pot over high heat add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and saute the onions, fennel, garlic and thyme until just colored. Reduce the heat to low and deglaze with the sake. Cover with a lid and cook for 30 minutes, stirring periodically until the onions are translucent and soft. Remove from heat.\\nIn a small bowl, using a fork, mix in the remaining herbs and the goat cheese and season with and salt and pepper, to taste.\\nWhile the onions are cooking, thinly slice the bread. Rub each piece with a garlic clove and season lightly with salt and pepper. Drizzle each piece with olive oil and bake until golden but still soft in the center, 10 minutes.\\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F.\\nIn order to achieve uniform cooking, fold over slender tail end of tenderloin and tie with kitchen twine. Set a large electric griddle at its highest setting; brush the tenderloin with the olive oil and sear on all sides until well browned, approximately 10 minutes.
