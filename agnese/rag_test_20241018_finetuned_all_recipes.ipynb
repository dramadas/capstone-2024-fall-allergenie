Divide the mixture into 12 equal portions and shape each portion into a ball. Flatten each ball slightly into a patty.\\n4. Brush the grill or grill pan with olive oil to prevent sticking. Grill the patties for 3-4 minutes per side, or until they reach your desired level of doneness.\\n5. While the patties are cooking, toast the slider buns on the grill or in a toaster.\\n6. Assemble the sliders by spreading a spoonful of Tomato Chile Jam on the bottom bun, followed by a cooked patty, a few cornichons, and a sprinkle of parsley. Top with the top bun.\\n\\n**Tomato Chile Jam:**\\n\\n(Recipe follows)\\n\\n**Ingredients:**\\n\\n1. 3 pounds peeled canned tomatoes\\n2. About 3 cups (750g) sugar\\n3. 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon (150g) cider vinegar\\n4. 1 1/2 teaspoons (25ml) fish sauce\\n5. 5 large cloves garlic, minced\\n6. 4 red hot chiles, finely chopped\\n7. 1 thumb fresh ginger, peeled and grated\\n\\n**Instructions:**\\n\\n1. In a medium saucepan, combine the canned tomatoes, sugar, cider vinegar, fish sauce, garlic, chiles, and ginger.\\n2. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the jam has thickened and reduced slightly.\\n3. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n\\n* You can make the Tomato Chile Jam ahead of time and store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.\\n* If you can't find New Zealand venison, you can substitute it with other game meats or even beef or pork.\\n* For an added crunch, top the sliders with some crispy bacon or chopped nuts.\"}\n"

Preheat oven to 225 degrees F.\\n2. In a standing mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip egg whites, cream of tartar, and granulated sugar to soft peaks at high speed.\\n3. Add the powdered sugar and flour, a third at a time. Whip on high speed to stiff peaks.\\n4. Fold in the peanuts.\\n5. Place batter in a piping bag, and pipe meringues into 2-inch long tubes onto a parchment paper-lined sheet tray.\\n6. Bake for 2 hours.\\n\\n**Hot Chocolate: Chocolate Caliente:**\\n\\n1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.\\n2. Butter a 6 to 8 inch square baking pan.\\n3. Sift the flour with the baking soda and salt onto a sheet of waxed paper.\\n4. Scrape the vanilla beans and reserve the pods and scrapings.\\n5. Place the vanilla and the butter in a small saucepan and heat until melted.\\n6. Beat the egg with the brown sugar at medium-high speed until it resembles very loose meringue, about 3 minutes, then add melted butter.\\n7. Reduce the speed, then add the flour and mix until not quite incorporated.\\n8. Add the nuts and chopped chocolate; fold until well blended.\\n9. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan.\\n10.
