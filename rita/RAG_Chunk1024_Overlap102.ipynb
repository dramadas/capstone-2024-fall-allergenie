To create a dairy-free version, I'll suggest some substitutions and modifications.\\n\\nHere's a revised recipe that replaces dairy products with dairy-free alternatives:\\n\\n**Title:** Dairy-Free Mac and Cheese\\n\\n**Ingredients:**\\n\\n* 1 pound elbow macaroni\\n* 2 1/2 cups non-dairy milk (such as almond, soy, or coconut milk)\\n* 1/2 cup vegan butter or margarine (such as Earth Balance)\\n* 3 cups dairy-free shredded cheese (such as Daiya or Follow Your Heart)\\n* 1 tablespoon sugar\\n* 1 teaspoon ground mustard\\n* Kosher salt\\n* 4 ounces vegan pancetta or tempeh, finely diced\\n* 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs\\n* 1 tablespoon minced fresh flat-leaf parsley\\n* Nonstick cooking spray\\n\\n**Instructions:**\\n\\n1. Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).\\n2. Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with non-dairy butter or margarine.\\n3. In a large bowl, combine the dairy-free shredded cheese, vegan butter or margarine, sugar, ground mustard, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.\\n4. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the macaroni and cook until al dente, about 1-2 minutes less than the recommended cooking time on the package. Drain well.\\n5. While the macaroni is still hot, dump it into the cheese mixture and toss to mix well.\\n6. In a small saucepan, bring the non-dairy milk to a bare simmer over medium heat.\\n7. In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg replacement (such as flaxseed or chia seeds mixed with water) and the warm milk until smooth.\\n8. Add the egg replacement mixture to the macaroni and cheese mixture, and stir until well combined.\\n9. Transfer the macaroni mixture to the prepared baking pan and top with the vegan pancetta or tempeh, panko breadcrumbs, and parsley.\\n10. Drizzle with non-dairy butter or margarine and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the macaroni is heated through.\\n\\nPlease note that this revised recipe may not have the exact same taste and texture as the original recipe, but it should still be a delicious and satisfying dairy-free alternative.\"}\n",

      "**Ingredients:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* 1 pound elbow macaroni\n",
      "* 2 1/2 cups non-dairy milk (such as almond, soy, or coconut milk)\n",
      "* 1/2 cup vegan butter or margarine (such as Earth Balance)\n",
      "* 3 cups dairy-free shredded cheese (such as Daiya or Follow Your Heart)\n",
      "* 1 tablespoon sugar\n",
      "* 1 teaspoon ground mustard\n",
      "* Kosher salt\n",
      "* 4 ounces vegan pancetta or tempeh, finely diced\n",
      "* 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs\n",
      "* 1 tablespoon minced fresh flat-leaf parsley\n",
      "* Nonstick cooking spray\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).\n",
      "2. Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with non-dairy butter or margarine.\n",
      "3. In a large bowl, combine the dairy-free shredded cheese, vegan butter or margarine, sugar, ground mustard, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.\n",
      "4. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the macaroni and cook until al dente, about 1-2 minutes less than the recommended cooking time on the package. Drain well.\n",
      "5. While the macaroni is still hot, dump it into the cheese mixture and toss to mix well.\n",
      "6. In a small saucepan, bring the non-dairy milk to a bare simmer over medium heat.\n",
      "7. In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg replacement (such as flaxseed or chia seeds mixed with water) and the warm milk until smooth.\n",
      "8. Add the egg replacement mixture to the macaroni and cheese mixture, and stir until well combined.\n",
      "9. Transfer the macaroni mixture to the prepared baking pan and top with the vegan pancetta or tempeh, panko breadcrumbs, and parsley.\n",
      "10. Drizzle with non-dairy butter or margarine and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the macaroni is heated through.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please note that this revised recipe may not have the exact same taste and texture as the original recipe, but it should still be a delicious and satisfying dairy-free alternative.\n"

Here's a recipe for Braised Onion and Broccoli Rabe with Fontina Cheese:\\n\\n**Title:** Braised Onion and Broccoli Rabe with Fontina Cheese\\n\\n**Ingredients:**\\n\\n- 1 teaspoon butter\\n- 2 cups white wine\\n- 10 ounces canned beef consomme\\n- 10 ounces chicken broth\\n- 10 ounces apple cider\\n- Bouquet garni (thyme sprigs, bay leaf, and parsley tied together with kitchen string)\\n- 1 loaf country-style bread\\n- Kosher salt\\n- Ground black pepper\\n- 1 cup Fontina or Gruyere cheese, grated\\n- 1 bunch broccoli rabe, cut crosswise into 1-inch squares\\n- 2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar\\n- 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil\\n- 2 tablespoons finely grated lemon zest\\n\\n**Instructions:**\\n\\n1. Set an electric skillet to 300 degrees and add the butter. Once melted, add a layer of onions and sprinkle with a little salt. Repeat layering onions and salt until all onions are in the skillet. Do not stir until onions have sweated down for 15 to 20 minutes.\\n2. After that, stir occasionally until onions are dark mahogany and reduced to approximately 2 cups. This should take 45 minutes to 1 hour. Do not worry about burning.\\n3. Add enough wine to cover the onions and turn heat to high, reducing the wine to a syrup consistency.\\n4. Add consomme, chicken broth, apple cider, and bouquet garni.\\n5. In a separate pan, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add broccoli rabe and cook, turning constantly with tongs, until wilted and bright green, about 5 minutes. Add vinegar and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.\\n6. Return the pasta to the cooking pot, add the vegetable mixture, and toss to combine well.\\n7. Serve hot.\\n\\nThis recipe does not contain gluten, making it suitable for those with gluten allergies or intolerance. Enjoy!\"}\n",

      "\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon butter\n",
      "- 2 cups white wine\n",
      "- 10 ounces canned beef consomme\n",
      "- 10 ounces chicken broth\n",
      "- 10 ounces apple cider\n",
      "- Bouquet garni (thyme sprigs, bay leaf, and parsley tied together with kitchen string)\n",
      "- 1 loaf country-style bread\n",
      "- Kosher salt\n",
      "- Ground black pepper\n",
      "- 1 cup Fontina or Gruyere cheese, grated\n",
      "- 1 bunch broccoli rabe, cut crosswise into 1-inch squares\n",
      "- 2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar\n",
      "- 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons finely grated lemon zest\n",

      "**Instructions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Set an electric skillet to 300 degrees and add the butter. Once melted, add a layer of onions and sprinkle with a little salt. Repeat layering onions and salt until all onions are in the skillet. Do not stir until onions have sweated down for 15 to 20 minutes.\n",
      "2. After that, stir occasionally until onions are dark mahogany and reduced to approximately 2 cups. This should take 45 minutes to 1 hour. Do not worry about burning.\n",
      "3. Add enough wine to cover the onions and turn heat to high, reducing the wine to a syrup consistency.\n",
      "4. Add consomme, chicken broth, apple cider, and bouquet garni.\n",
      "5. In a separate pan, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add broccoli rabe and cook, turning constantly with tongs, until wilted and bright green, about 5 minutes. Add vinegar and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.\n",
      "6. Return the pasta to the cooking pot, add the vegetable mixture, and toss to combine well.\n",
      "7. Serve hot.\n",
